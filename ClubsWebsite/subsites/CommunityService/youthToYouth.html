<br>Other Information:</br>
 All activities promote a drug-free lifestyle. Students actively plan and conduct activities to reduce the harm of addiction and drug use. 
 Students create radio ads that play on local stations; create presentations to perform in schools all over New England; perform skits;
 propose changes in state or local laws; and hold community events to get their message out. 
 They also plan recreational events for members of Y-to-Y, just to have fun.
