French Club
Teacher:
Mrs. Provencher

Funding:
We sell food and have raffles

Meetings:
Wednesdays at Room 142

What we do:
The main purposes of the French Club are to promote enthusiasm among students for the French language and culture and to provide students with a friendly but serious way to approach a new language. 
Because of the club's interest in cultural diversity, involvement in the French Club also encourages exploration of other cultures. 
Through the many activities held by the club, Members will have the opportunity to organize and discuss French film viewings, celebrate French Holidays, explore French cuisine, and more. 
This type of interaction enables greater understanding and appreciation, on both sides, of the other's culture. Members of The French Club encourage to attend weekly meeting.  
However, they may attend at the very least one meeting a month to keep their membership in good standing.  Additionally, they may log on to the club's website:  dhsfrenchclub.wordpress.com  for updates.
