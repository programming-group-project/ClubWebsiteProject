Latin CLub
 Latin Club is all about camaraderie. Led by j.connelly@sau11.org"Ms. Connely(Magistra). We meet in room 142 on Fridays, and meeting information will be sent to people on the mailing list or on the announcements. This is a time for Latin students to socialize and mix. We eat food, plan themed parties for Halloween and Saturnalia (or, commonly known as Christmas). During our events we invite other clubs to have fun. Latin Club has been hosting the annual event Granite State Certamen, 
 like Jeopardy but LATIN! We promote Latin and good will throughout the school.

There are no requirements, but mostly Latin students.
Fundraising Projects:
We host a plethora of fundraising projects, such as cakewalks. We may do some community service-based projects in the future.
