Description of Club:
The Pulsera Project is a nonprofit organization that educates, empowers, and connects Central American artists with students in more than 2,100 U.S. schools through the sale of colorful handwoven fair trade bracelets, or "pulseras" in Spanish. Fair Trade projects support farmers and craftspeople in developing countries who are socially and economically marginalized and often face steep hurdles in finding markets and customers for their goods. By bringing their products into the global marketplace, Fair Trade businesses greatly expand opportunity for these small-scale artists and farmers while also educating consumers about the serious impact that their purchases can have on people's lives all over the world. The National Spanish Exam is a chance to test oneself in Spanish at a National level against thousands of other language learners and complete for a Bronze, Silver or Gold prize.
