		<br>Gaming Club is where you go for adventures in role-playing, defeat your classmates in a board game, win a couple hands of cards, or fight against your friends in digital combat.
		We do tournaments for fun and large social games. It's a great place to kick back and play some games, from board to digital. Bring your own game, or play any one in our ever-growing library.
