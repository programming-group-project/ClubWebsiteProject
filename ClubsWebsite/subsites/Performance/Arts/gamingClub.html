Requirements to join:


Meetings:
Usually we meet in room 254, but if the room is unavailable, then we'll meet in room 257.

Info:
Gaming Club is where you go for adventures in role-playing, defeat your classmates in a board game, win a couple hands of cards, or fight against your friends in digital combat.
We do tournaments for fun and large social games. It's a great place to kick back and play some games, from board to digital. Bring your own game, or play any one in our ever-growing library.
