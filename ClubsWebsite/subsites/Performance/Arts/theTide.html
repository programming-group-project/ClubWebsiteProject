			<br>We are the voice of Dover High School. The tide is the official student-run news source for our school community. Student Work in connection with the journalism course to produce several newspapers
			and manage our website. There are many opportunities for students to bring their individual skills as we need more than just writers to produce an excellent paper. We're looking not only for our writers and reporters,
			but also photographers, graphic designers, website managers, artists, camera operators, creative writers, managers of all levels of experience. One need not have any background in journalism to be part of the club.
