		<br>Run by Mr. Watton, the soccer team meets and performs during the Fall. In order to join, you must be passing most of your classes, as well as having an up-to-date physical on-file. There's a 75$ transportation fee. Applications are done through the FamilyID right on the school website. There are two fundraisers that are done for this team: an 80$ Booster club, as well as a calendar sales fundraiser. The team meets at the soccer field, although sometimes also at room 136. Competitions are state-wide. The team also practices together. All information regarding practices and games is available on the team's Snapchat.
