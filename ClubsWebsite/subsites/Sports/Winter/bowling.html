		<br>Bowling is a team as well as individual sport. High schools participate in a Co-ed league. A team can qualify for the state tournament made up of the top 10 teams in the league, and individual bowlers competing for their high school can qualify for the individual state tournament. It's all based on averages. Bowlers compete in scratch games (no handicaps).
